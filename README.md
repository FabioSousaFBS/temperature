  <h1>Temperature</h1>
  <p>Temperature is a Flutter application that allows users to check the weather forecast for a specific city or the current device location. The application was developed following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, which ensures high code quality and reliability of the implemented features.</p>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>The Temperature app includes the following features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>City-based weather search: Users can search for the weather forecast for any city by typing the city name in the search bar. The application will retrieve the weather information for the selected city and display the results on the screen.</li>
    <li>Location-based weather forecast: The application also allows users to obtain the weather forecast for their current device location. By granting access to their device's location, the app retrieves the weather information for the user's region.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Clean Architecture</h2>
  <p>The Temperature app was developed using the Clean Architecture approach. This architecture promotes the separation of concerns by dividing the application into different layers, each with a specific responsibility, making the code more maintainable and scalable.</p>
  <p>The Clean Architecture approach enables the use of dependency injection, making it easier to replace or update external dependencies in the future.</p>
